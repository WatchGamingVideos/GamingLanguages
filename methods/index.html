      learning in general and learning languages in particular. 
      It also gives very practical advices about techniques (e.g. 
      <a href="../techniques/spacedrepetition.html">spaced repetition</a>)
      and tools.<br />
      The 
      <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/">accompanying website</a>

      Learn to Speak Any Language from Anywhere in the World</span></a>. 
      HarperCollins, 2014 (256 p.).
    </p>
    <p>Benny Lewis is an Irishman who did not enjoy learning languages before 
      reaching adulthood, when he started looking for more efficient and 
      enjoyable methods. The result is the above book,
      a <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">website</a>,
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqUeWshwMs">TEDx talk</a> and 
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fluentinthreemonths/">YouTube channel</a>
      (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/irishpolyglot/">another 
      YouTube channel</a>).
      Some of his blog posts are about
      <strong><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/category/main-categories/language-hacks/">language
      hacks</a></strong>; some of these blog posts focus on specific languages,
      while others are more general.<br />
      His most important piece of advice is to start speaking from the first
      day instead of worrying about mistakes. 
      Some language learners find that Benny Lewis' method is
      <a href="http://languagebug.co.uk/should-you-learn-grammar-weekly-round/">something
      for extroverts</a>. 
      Lewis also wrote a controversial blog post titled 
      <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/stop-being-shy/">The Shy Delusion</a>
      (claiming, for example, that only 1% of people are introverts), which
      drew some criticism, for example on the website
      <a href="http://fluencyforintroverts.com/about/">Fluency for Introverts</a>.

    <p>This book describes techniques for learning vocabulary and grammar, 
      and for improving reading skills, writing skills, listening skilss
      and oral skills. The book is mainly based on the author's experience
      with teaching English; the author does not appear to have any 
      experience with non-Indo-European languages. The book also predates
      the development of electronic spaced repetition systems, so the chapter
      about learning vocabulary explains a system with paper-based flash cards
      as recommended by <span lang="de">Paul Schmidt</span> and described by 
      <span lang="de">Sebastian Leitner</span>.
