    <p>Benny Lewis is an Irishman who did not enjoy learning languages before 
      reaching adulthood, when he started looking for more efficient and 
      enjoyable methods. The result is the above book,
      a <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">website</a>,
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqUeWshwMs">TEDx talk</a> and

      Some of his blog posts are about
      <strong><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/category/main-categories/language-hacks/">language hacks</a></strong>; 
      some of these blog posts focus on specific languages,
      while others are more general.<br />
      His most important piece of advice is to start speaking from the first
      day instead of worrying about mistakes. 
      Some language learners find that Benny Lewis' method is
      <a href="http://languagebug.co.uk/should-you-learn-grammar-weekly-round/">something for extroverts</a>. 
      Lewis also wrote a controversial blog post titled 
      <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/stop-being-shy/">The Shy Delusion</a>
      (claiming, for example, that only 1% of people are introverts), which

    <p>Brown, Peter C.; Roediger, Henry L. III; McDaniel, Mark A.:

      class="booktitle">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</span></a>. 
      Cambridge, MA, London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2014
      (336 p.).
    </p>
    <p>This book was written by two professors of cognitive psychology (Roediger 
      and McDaniel) who teamed up with a novelist. 
      The book is not specifically about learning languages but about 
      learning in general. Many people learn in an ineffective way, but 
      research in cognitive psychology has helped discover better techniques
      and habits. Many of these techniques and habits are counterintuitive.
    </p>
    <p>The book itself also uses two important learning
      principles: spaced repetition of important ideas and the interleaving
      of different but related topics. It is up to the reader how to apply
      the learning techniques and habits to the study of languages;
      &ldquo;language&rduo; does not even have an entry in the index.

    <h3 id="clugston">The (German) Volume Method</h3>
    <p>The Volume Method (or German Volume Method) is a self-learning approach based on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlearning">overlearning</a>.
      The method was formulated by the linguist Christophe Clugston
      based on information on performance enhancement methods from East Germans he met in the early 1990s and
      on research. 
      <br />Clugston points out that the Volume Method (or any other self-learning method)
      does not replace the classroom experience and that 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_%28linguistics%29#List_of_tonal_languages">tonal languages</a> 
      such as Standard Chinese do not lend themselves to self-learning.
      He also points out that the Volume Method is for serious study only, not for people who want to play with languages.
      It works for any level and you need to spend 1 to 4 hours per day on language learning.
      It probably takes 10 months to get through a single &ldquo;cycle&rdquo;.
      <br />The language is described in a <abbr>PDF</abbr> file that you can buy on
      <a href="http://www.language-busters.com/?page_id=9">Clugston's website</a> (payment through PayPal);
      Clugston also sells &ldquo;Right Brain Extensions&rdquo;.
      <br />Clugston's YouTube channel has several videos about the Volume Method (though they don't give too many details):
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl6TPqlHf5I">ELITE language learning, How to get the German Volume Method</a> (8 November 2013),

      <br />
      Christophe Clugston has indicated in a 
      <a href="http://thelanguagedojo.com/2010/01/learn-language-scratch-studying-grammar/#comment-4266">blog comment</a> 
      that he considers 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_physical_response">total physical response (<abbr>TPR</abbr>)</a>
      as the best teaching method for beginners, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPR_Storytelling">Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (<abbr>TPRS</abbr>)</a>
      as a method for going further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clugston's description does not focus on any specific language but 
      some users of the method have described their experiences on blogs and in forums.
      For discussions and reviews of the method, see for example the discussion 
      <a href="https://www.lingq.com/forum/4/21630/">Clugston's "German Volume Method"</a>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/">The Polyglot Dream</a> is a
      website by the Italian polyglot Luca Lampariello, who claims fluency
      in 10 languages. His website offers
      <q cite="http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/about/">strategies</q>, not hacks,
      for learning languages. The central concept of his method is his
      <q cite="http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/about/">focus on developing 
      <b>a solid language core</b>: the ability to put words and sounds together 
      in order to talk to people about what interests me in a natural way.</q>

      <li>Scott Young &amp; Vat Jaiswal:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1RRbupCxi0">One Simple Method to Learn Any Language</a>, 
        TEDxEastsidePrep, Seattle, Washington,
        <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/12617">20 March 2015</a>.
        The method described in this video can be summarised as immersion in a
        country where the language is spoken, combined with the "no-English rule",
        <abbr>i.e.</abbr> avoiding English as a fallback from the start
        (English is the native language of both speakers).
        The speakers tested this method with several languages (Spanish, Korean,
        Standard Chinese).

        (October 2014). This excerpt from
        <a href="http://l2mastery.com/language-guides/master-japanese/">Master Japanese</a>
        describes an &ldquo;immersion schedule&rdquo; that can be <q>tweaked to
        fit any lifestyle or work schedule</q> and can be adapted to other languages.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q3Mf1Nwfkw">Anthony Lauder: A Polyglot's Daily Language Learning Routine</a>
        (12 minutes, YouTube, September 2013).
        Interview with Anthony Lauder, who is retired. 
        Lauder always has one main language - German at the time of the interview - and several other languages (Czech, Mandarin, Vietnamese, &hellip;).
        He studies in blocks of 20-25 minutes, which is his maximum concentration span. 
        Part of the morning is dedicated to intensive studying, 
        while the afternoon is more relaxed (&ldquo;play&rdquo;): he focuses on authentic materials such as videos and books, and on language production (self talk, real-time translation, &hellip;).
        One should also expect to forget things and a feeling of slow progress; these are tricks that your brain plays on you.
        The &ldquo;secreta&rdquo; to learning languages is <strong>persistence</strong>.
