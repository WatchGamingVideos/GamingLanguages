      Learn to Speak Any Language from Anywhere in the World</span></a>. 
      HarperCollins, 2014 (256 p.).
    </p>
    <p>Benny Lewis is an Irishman who did not enjoy learning languages before 
      reaching adulthood, when he started looking for more efficient and 
      enjoyable methods. The result is the above book,
      a <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">website</a>,
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqUeWshwMs">TEDx talk</a> and 
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fluentinthreemonths/">YouTube channel</a>
      (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/irishpolyglot/">another 
      YouTube channel</a>).
      Some of his blog posts are about
      <strong><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/category/main-categories/language-hacks/">language
      hacks</a></strong>; some of these blog posts focus on specific languages,
      while others are more general.<br />
      His most important piece of advice is to start speaking from the first
      day instead of worrying about mistakes. 
      Some language learners find that Benny Lewis' method is
      <a href="http://languagebug.co.uk/should-you-learn-grammar-weekly-round/">something
      for extroverts</a>. 
      Lewis also wrote a controversial blog post titled 
      <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/stop-being-shy/">The Shy Delusion</a>
      (claiming, for example, that only 1% of people are introverts), which
      drew some criticism, for example on the website
      <a href="http://fluencyforintroverts.com/about/">Fluency for Introverts</a>.
