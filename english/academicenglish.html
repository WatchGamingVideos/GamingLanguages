    <p>This page is about the English skills that non-native speakers need in an academic context,
      especially when writing papers and reports.
      Since there are 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_English">many varieties of English</a> (not just 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British English</a> and 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American English</a>), 
      and most people in Europe learn British English at school,
      the descriptions of the resources below mention which variety of English is used or taught.
    </p>

    <p>Many papers and other academic publications are written by non-native speakers of English.
      This page contains some guidelines to help improve the readability and grammar of these documents. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>A few reminders and notes</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This page is <strong>work in progress</strong>.</li>
      <li>Most of this page is about British English. If you prefer American or Canadian English, 
        you're on your own (but check out the references at the end of this page).<!-- @@add section with references and link to it -->
      </li>
      <li>Many native speakers may be used to a more informal writing style. This guide, however, is about academic English and therefore assumes a formal writing style.</li>
      <li>Many of the examples below come from deliverables produced in European research &amp; development projects 
        (projects funded by the European Commission and executed by consortia of organisations from all over Europe).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Advice</h2>
    <p>One of the sources of difficult prose is the "curse of knowledge": the inability to imagine that the reader does not know what you know. 
      The following tips can help you exorcise the curse of knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep in mind "the reader over your shoulder", <abbr>i.e.</abbr> try to imagine what the intended reader knows or does not know.</li>
      <li>Let a representative reader review a draft of your text. Ideally, this reader is an intelligent person who is <em>not</em> an expert in your field.</li>
      <li>Leave the text alone for a few months before rereading it. This way, you can be a surrogate for the "representative reader".</li>
      <li>Read the text aloud. This will help you detect some verbiage and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28linguistics%29">hedging</a> 
        that looks fine on the screen but does not work when read aloud.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spelling</h2>
    <h3><abbr>UK</abbr>, <abbr>US</abbr>, Canadian, &hellip; Spelling</h3>
    <h4>General Guidance</h4>
    <p>Choose a spelling convention and stick to it throughout the document. 
      Make sure that the document's <strong>language setting</strong> matches the spelling convention you have chosen. 
      In Microsoft Word you can check the language setting in the status bar below the editing area. 
      You can make sure that the language setting is consistent throughout the document by pressing <kbd>Control+A</kbd> 
      (to select all the content) and selecting the appropriate language under 
      Review > Language > Set Proofing Language&hellip; 
    </p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <h5>-our versus -or</h5>
    <p><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: (foreground) colour, &hellip;; <abbr>US</abbr> spelling: (foreground) color, &hellip;</p>
    <h5>-er versus -re</h5>
    <p><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: centre, home theatre, &hellip;; 
      <abbr>US</abbr> spelling: center, home theater, &hellip;
    </p>
    <h5>-ce versus -se</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: a licence, to license (or to licence), practice makes perfect, to practise, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: a license, to license, practice makes perfect, to practice, &hellip; <!-- @@check --></li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, when citing the title of a specific licence, use the spelling used by that licence, e.g. "the General Public License (GPL), version 3.0". </p>
    <h5>-ise/-yse versus -ize/-yze</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: customise, initialisation, organisation, analyse, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: customize, initialization, organization, analyze, &hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: many organisations in the <abbr>UK</abbr> use the spelling with '-ize' and '-ization'. 
      This is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling">Oxford spelling</a> or 
      <abbr>OED</abbr> spelling. However, this does not affect the spelling of <strong>analyse</strong>!
    </p>
    <h5>-ll- versus -l-</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: modelling, modelled, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: modeling, modeled, &hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>-e- in ageing, gamification, &hellip;</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: ageing (see <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ageing?q=ageing">Cambridge</a> and 
        <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ageing?q=ageing">Oxford</a>; 
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ageing?showCookiePolicy=true">Collins</a> also accepts 'aging'), 
        gamification (without 'e'; <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gamification?q=gamification">Oxford dictionary</a>), &hellip;
      </li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: aging (see <a href="aging (see Webster), gamification">Webster</a>), gamification, &hellip;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Many -ing forms have been accepted as adjectives and don't have in 'e' in British English, e.g. in "a raging thirst".</li>
      <li>Sometimes, there is a difference in meaning: singing comes form the verb 'to sing', while singeing comes from the verb 
        '<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/singe">to singe</a>' (to burn slightly).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frequently Misspelled Words</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>screen reader (always written with a space)</li>
      <li>to fulfil (fulfilled); <abbr>US</abbr>: to fulfill</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Capitalisation (Upper Case or Lower Case)</h3>
    <p>The following rules are not exhaustive but should be sufficient for writing papers and other academic publications. 
      <br />Capitalise: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>names of people, places, organisations, institutions;</li>
      <li>months and days of the week;</li>
      <li>titles of documents (books, deliverables) and journals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do not capitalise: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>nouns (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> project, deliverable, report, social network, &hellip;);</li>
      <li>in titles: prepositions (in, at, for) shorter than five letters, and articles (a, an, the), except when they are the first word in a title.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no consensus on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internet or internet (a place or a technology?);</li>
      <li>the Web &amp; the World Wide Web or the web & the world wide web.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples from project deliverables: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"this Deliverable" -> "this deliverable". The word "deliverable" is not a title but an ordinary noun. </li>
      <li>"&hellip; to access the Social Networks" -> "&hellip; to access (the) social networks"</li>
      <li>"the Remote Control" -> "the remote control"</li>
      <li>"He uses Hotmail for emails, google docs for documents, &hellip;" -> "He uses Hotmail for emails, Google Docs for &hellip;": 
        Hotmail and Google Docs are names.
      </li>
      <li>Examples of unusual capitalisation: TalkBack (Android feature), 
        <a href="http://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/papers/webanywhere-html/">WebAnywhere</a> (web-based screen reader), &hellip;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hyphens Versus One Word or Separate Words</h3>
    <p>The hyphen or dash is used: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>in (attributive) adjectives formed from two or more words, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a well-researched paper, a 30-year-old pilot, 
        but not necessarily in predicative adjectives, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "this paper is well researched" 
        (see <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/adjectiv/attribut.htm">Attributive and Predicative Adjectives</a>)
      </li>
      <li>in most words that begin with anti, counter, half, inter, non and semi</li>
      <li>in ex- when it means 'former': ex-wife</li>
      <li> to replace 'and', e.g. "the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator"</li>
      <li>to avoid ambiguity; for example:
        <ul>
          <li>a "heavy metal detector" is a heavy detector made of metal, 
            while a "heavy-metal detector" is a detector of 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> 
            (example borrowed from <a href="http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/hyphens_in_compound_adjectives.htm">Grammar Monster</a>);</li>
          <li>"re-sign" means to sign again, "resign" means to quit a job or position;</li>
          <li>"re-cover" means to provide with a new cover, "recover" means to get well again.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>to avoid a confusing sequence of letters, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "re-enter a password", "pre-echo", "pre-eminent" 
        (but the hyphen is usually not needed in words with pre- followed by a consonant, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> prepaid)
      </li>
      <li>in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound#Using_a_group_of_compound_nouns_containing_the_same_.22head.22">compounds containing the same "head"</a>, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "cloud- and web-based" (note the "hanging hyphen" after 'cloud')
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not a full list. 
      <a href="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/hyphens">The Economists' Style Guide</a> 
      gives more rules and examples. When in doubt, consult a dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>Many new terms start out as two words, then become hyphenated, and finally become accepted as a single word. 
      In some cases, there is no consensus whether a term should be written with a hyphen or as one word. 
      <!-- @@outdated; find new example.
      For example, most words starting with "auto" are written as one word, but "autosuggestion" is written without a hyphen in the 
      <a href="http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/autosuggestion?q=autosuggestion">Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>, the 
      <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/autosuggestion">Collins English Dictionary</a> and the 
      <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/autosuggestion?a=british&q=autosuggestion">Cambridge Dictionary Online</a>,
      but was written with a hyphen ("auto-suggestion") in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary before 2014. 
      -->
    </p>
    <p>Examples from deliverables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"low-vision users" (though the phrase "users with low vision" is more correct)</li>
      <li>"a multi-user application"</li>
      <li>"Web-based screen reader" (needs a hyphen because "Web-based" is used as an attribute)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of words written with a hyphen: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>fine-tune</li>
      <li>hands-on demonstration/training/&hellip;</li>
      <li>hearing-impaired (some dictionaries list "hearing impaired" as an alternative)</li>
      <li>real-life scenarios/footage/&hellip;</li>
      <li><a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/real-time?a=british">real-time</a> 
        (as an attribute; derived from the noun "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/real+time">real time</a>")
      </li>
      <li>well-known</li>
      <li>cost-benefit analysis</li>
      <li>a step-by-step approach (because used as an adjective; compare: "we will proceed step by step")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of words without a space or hyphen</p>
    <ul>
      <li>deafblind (adjective)</li>
      <li>workflow</li>
      <li>smartphone</li>
      <li>prepilot (though some spelling correctors prefer "pre-pilot")</li>
      <li>pretest (<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pretest?q=pretest">Oxford</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pretest">Collins</a>; 
        <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pretest?q=pretest">Cambridge</a> also accepts pre-test)
      </li>
      <li>shortcut (noun and verb; 
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shortcut?showCookiePolicy=true">Collins</a> 
        used to allow the hyphen in the verb&mdash;short-cut&mdash;but no longer does now)
      </li>
      <li>multimodal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of words with a space:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>end user (however, when the phrase is used as a modifier, you add a hyphen, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "end-user experience")</li>
      <li>screen reader</li>
      <li>smart house</li>
      <li>task force</li>
      <li>data type</li>
      <li>value space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Special cases: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>e-mail / email: There is no consensus on the spelling of "e-mail" or "email", but the spelling without the hyphen tends to be favoured.
        <br />(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email#Terminology">Email: Terminology (Wikipedia)</a>, 
        "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2011/apr/04/language">Think hyphens aren't contro-versial? Think again</a>" 
        (<i class="newspaper">The Guardian</i>, 4 April 2011), 
        <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/communications/publications/writing/style-guide/">University of York: University Style Guide</a>, 
        <a href="https://portal.uea.ac.uk/arm/publications/logos-and-brand-guidelines/writing-style-guide">University of East Anglia: Writing Style Guide</a>.)
      </li>
      <li>run time (<a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/run-time?showCookiePolicy=true">Collins</a>)&nbsp;/ 
        run-time (<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/run-time?a=business-english&q=run%20time">Cambridge</a>, 
        which also allows "runtime")&nbsp;/ 
        runtime (<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/runtime?q=run-time">Oxford</a>). 
        However, when used as an adjective before a noun, the spelling is either run-time or runtime: 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a run-time environment / a runtime environment.
      </li>
      <li>"front end" versus "front-end": 
        <ul>
          <li>"front end" and "back end" (without a hyphen) are nouns, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "the front end of a mobile application", "the back end of the server";</li>
          <li>"front-end" and "back-end" (with a hyphen) are used attributively (see above), e.g. "a front-end fee" (=paid in advance).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Punctuation</h2>
    <h3>Comma</h3>
    <p>The comma is used in the following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To replace "and" or "or" in an enumeration or a similar series of items, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>: 
        <ul>
          <li>"The guidelines do not cover the needs of people with all types, degrees and combinations of disabilities."
          </li>
          <li>"George shot the video, Maria added captions to it and Ignacio uploaded it to the server."
          </li>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>American English</strong> places a comma before the final "and". 
            <strong>British English</strong> only places a comma before the final "and" when the penultimate item in the list includes another "and". 
            For example: 
            <ul>
              <li>"He ordered coffee, bacon and eggs, and toast."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To combine two sentences into a single one by means of a conjunction such as "but", "yet", "while" or "so": 
        <ul>
          <li>"The first evaluation phase will experience some delay, but this will not affect the next phases."
          </li>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: If the subject of the second sentence is omitted, or if the conjunction is "and" or "or", the comma is not obligatory. 
            For example:
            <ul>
              <li>"The peer reviewers found the deliverable unsatisfactory(,) but did not give advice on how to improve the document."
              </li>
              <li>"The peer reviewers proposed several changes to improve the deliverable(,) and the authors followed the proposals."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After an introductory adverb (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> "nevertheless", "however", "suddenly"), an introductory phrase or a parenthetical phrase:
        <ul>
          <li><q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_water">Surface and ground water are two separate entities, so they must be regarded as such.

          <li>"In Windows, for example, you can choose between different desktop themes." 
            <br /><strong>Note</strong>: "For example" is not always a <em>parenthetical phrase</em>, 
            <abbr>i.e.</abbr> removing the phrase changes the meaning of the sentences or creates a meaningless construction.
            <br />Example: "He sometimes has difficulty reading the screen, <em>for example</em> when his eyes get tired."
          </li>
        </ul>

        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_relative_clauses#Restrictive_or_non-restrictive_relative_clauses">non-restrictive relative clause</a>"

          <li>"<em>The son of a shoe maker</em>, he gained a place at King’s School Canterbury from where he won a Parker scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge."

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Note the difference in meaning between, "I saw a film which was very boring" and "I saw a film, which was very boring". 
        The first sentence implies that the film I saw was very boring, while the second implies that watching films was a boring activity. 
        In the first sentence, "which" can be replaced with "that"; this is not possible in the second sentence. 
        In speech, there would be a pause before "which" in the second sentence, but not in the first sentence. 
        Grammatically speaking, the first sentence contains a "restrictive relative clause" (the which clause restrict the meaning of "film" to one particular film), while the second sentence contains a "non-restrictive relative clause" (the which clause just provides some additional information but the main clause does not change in meaning without the which clause).
      </li>
      <li>You do not write a comma to introduce a "restrictive relative clause", 
        <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a clause that is necessary to identify the person or thing you are talking about. 
        <abbr>E.g.</abbr>: 
        <ul>
          <li>The man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world. (Oscar Wilde)
          </li>
          <li>The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them. (Mark Twain)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Semicolon</h3>
    <p>Outside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#Programming">programming</a>, 
      the semicolon is mainly used in two situations. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>To join two complete sentences without a connecting word such as <em>and</em> or <em>but</em> 
        and when the colon is not a valid alternative. Example: 
        <ul>
          <li>Some matchmakers are already implemented and integrated into the Cloud4all Personalisation framework; 
            other matchmakers will be implemented in the next project years. 
            (Quoted from Cloud4all deliverable D204.1.)<!-- @@add link -->
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To separate items in a list that already contain commas. Example: 
        <ul>
          <li>The people present were Jamie, who came from New Zealand; John, the milkman's son; and George, a gaunt kind of man. 
            (Quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon">Wikipedia: Semicolon</a>.)

      <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/colonandsemi/semi">Guide to Punctuation</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Colon</h3>
    <p>The colon is used to illustrate, explain or elaborate the preceding sentence.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code contributed to <abbr>GPII</abbr> should be made available under one of the following licences: 
        the Apache License 2.0, the <abbr>BSD</abbr> 3-Clause License or the <abbr>MIT</abbr> License.
      </li>
      <li>To install an extension in OpenOffice, proceed as follows: 
        open the Extension Manager in the Tools menu, click "Add&hellip;", browse to the folder where you downloaded the extension, 
        click "Open" and follow the instructions that appear during the installation process.
      </li>
      <li>The presentation is available in two formats: <abbr>ODF</abbr> and <abbr>PDF</abbr>.
      </li>
      <li>I had a rough weekend: I had chest pain and spent all Saturday and Sunday in the Emergency room. 
        (Quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_%28punctuation%29#Usage">Wikipedia: Colon</a>.)
        <!-- @@check above URL -->
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The colon is also used to introduce a longer quotation that is marked off from the rest of the text by indentation. Example:</p>
    <blockquote class="neutralquote">
      <p>As Samuel Johnson wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Every man naturally persuades himself that he can keep his resolutions, 
        nor is he convinced of his imbecility but by length of time and frequency of experiment.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <h3>Long Dash</h3>
    <p>The hyphen (-) is not the appropriate punctuation mark for parenthetical remarks; use the long dash (—) instead.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/--">Two successive hyphens</a><!-- @@check URL --> do not replace a long dash, 
      though some word processors may automatically replace the double hyphen with a long dash.
