          <br />Elliott starts this video with a quote from Eric Thomas:
          <!--"33 Motivational Quotes from Eric Thomas’ Secrets to Success Speech": https://www.lifesuccessquotes.com/33-motivational-quotes-from-eric-thomas-secrets-to-success-speech/-->
          <q>“Look, don’t cry to give up! Cry to keep going!!” Don’t cry to quit!</q>
          When you study hard and you get sick of trying because you don't see any improvement, this can make you feel sad.
          You need to learn to use your frustration and/or anger as a source of motivation.
          When someone laughs at you or tells you that you can't do something, go home and study to prove them wrong.

          (<i><abbr>ETJ</abbr> English</i> on YouTube, 5 minutes, 06.06.2016).
          <br />It is impossible to determine the number of words you need to know to be a good English speaker.
          You should not exclusively focus on vocabulary or try to learn every word just because you want to.
          If you want to become a fluent speaker of English, you should try using the words you already know.

          <br />Elliott has a few recommendations. Of course, you need to continue learning until you feel confident with your English.
          If you feel nervous about speaking, the best thing you can do is practise speaking to yourself or to somebody you feel close with.
          You can talk to yourself in the mirror or you can record your own voice and listen back to it.
          You can also try to overcome your shyness by pretending to be someone else, for example, pretend that you are a native speaker.

        the intrusive r and linking r (which is covered in another video), using the glottal t instead of the normal t (though not all the time),
        the /ɒ/ sound (e.g. in "problem", which is pronounced differently in American English) and the /ɜː/ sound (e.g. as in "word" and "purple").

        In order to make your speech a little bit faster and more native-sounding, you need to learn to use the linking r, e.g. in questions, sentences and phrases such as
        "Where are you?", "I have four eggs", "harder and harder" and "Where is the fire exit?"
        The intrusive r is optional. It occurs when there is no r in the words (spelling) but it appears in speech.
        It can be inserted into phrases such as "Australia and England", "media event" and "I saw a great film last night."

      * Differences Between British and American Pronunciation, 7 minutes, 08.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTT5FfTpLTQ
        This video does not cover the basic differences, which have been covered in many other YouTube videos.
        British English uses a much more frontal and tense accent, whereas American pronunciation is more relaxed.
        British vowels are shorter than American ones.
        British speakers pronounce the t between vowels differently, whereas American speakers pronounce it more like a d.
        British speakers also know the glottal t, although is not used equally frequently in all dialects.
        British speakers introduce a /j/ sound in words such as news, Tuesday and tube (and YouTube).
      * British Pronunciation Lesson - Assimilation, 6 minutes, 15.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hSMB2cOqv0
        Assimilation is the modification in the final sound of a word to connect it with the next word, e.g. in "Bless you".
        This happens in different situations:
        (1) The final s of a word merges with the initial /j/ or /ʃ/ of the next word to become /ʃ/, e.g. in "bless you", "dress shoes" and "What makes you angry?"
        (2) The final t or d of a word merges with the /j/ of the next word /rʃ/ or /dʒ/, respectively, e.g. in "Nice to meet you?", "Can't you come to the party?", "You're from England, aren't you"?" and
        "Where did you get your top?"
      * Informal Contractions in British English, 7 minutes, 22.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk7yDmv0G3w
        Informal contractions are not considered "correct" or formal British English, but you need to know them in order to understand native speakers.
        There are only a few of these in British English, namely wanna for wantt to (D'ya wanna coffee? I wanna go shopping tomorrow.),
        gonna for going to (I was gonna tell you something.),
        innit for isn't it (It's cold outside today, innit?),
        gimme for give me (Can you gimme a sec?)

      * Everyday Idioms & Expressions Used in Britain, 8 minutes, 08.03.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfFMlDhkDpk
        Some schools that teach English as a foreign language teach outdated idioms. Elliott teaches a few informal idioms that are still used today:
        to drive someone around the bend, to do somebody's head in, to feel under the weather, to feel rough,
        to be over the moon, at the end of the day, to get a grip, a piece of piss (vulgar equivalent to the American idiom "a piece of cake"),
        to take the piss. [6:40 forehead]
      * Using Phrasal Verbs to Improve Pronunciation, 9 minutes, 15.03.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T19_t0KIGOE
        Elliott gives a set of examples of phrasal verbs that feature either linking or intrusive sounds.
        (1) throw out /θroʊˈwaʊt/ and chuck out /tʃʌˈkaʊt/.
        (2) pass out /pɑːˈsaʊt/ (Elliott also points out that people in Bristol and the North of England say /pæsaʊt/.)
        (3) go ahead /goʊwəˈhed/.
        (4) pack it in /pækɪˈtɪn/.
        (5) run into /rʌˈnɪntuː/. (6) do up (/duːwʌp/). (7) give out (/gɪvaʊt/).
