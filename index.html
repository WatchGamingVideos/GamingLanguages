    <p>Success in learning foreign languages is determined by three things:
      motivation (or persistence), time and a good method.
      Language learning methods are individual: methods and techniques that work for one person may not work well for others.
    </p>
    <p>The goal of this website is to collect resources, techniques and methods 
      for learning foreign languages, so learners can make informed choices about their language learning. 
      The site lists both online and offline resources.
    </p>
    <p>The site content is based on a variety of sources: 
      webpages, videos, books and other content created by successful language learners (including polyglots),
      tips and learning materials for specific languages, 
      and academic research into second language acquisition (<abbr>SLA</abbr>).

        Paul discusses the usual suspects, such as teaching languages, translating and interpreting, 
        but also mentions jobs where language is not the primary skill:
        international sales, the diplomatic service, tourism (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> tour guide) or
        flight attendant.
        <br />Most importantly, Paul points out that if you want to benefit from your language skills, you should know what you want to get from the language when you start learning it.
