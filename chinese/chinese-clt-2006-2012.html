    <p>The <span lang="nl">Centrum voor Levende Talen</span> (<abbr>CLT</abbr>) in Leuven, Belgium,
      is a language school that offers many language courses that are typically
      organised as evening classes. One of the languages that can be learnt is
      Standard Chinese. The Chinese language courses at <abbr>CLT</abbr> are a bit
      different from most language courses elsewhere, and, above all, much better.
      This article is about the Standard Chinese language courses offered at
      <abbr>CLT</abbr> between 2006 and 2012.
    </p>
    <p>In Belgium, many language courses are not semester based but follow the
      &ldquo;school years&rdquo; that apply to most of the educational system.
      At <abbr>CLT</abbr>, there are exams in January and June, and only those who pass the exams
      can move up to the next year. People with previous knowledge of a language
      need to take a placement test.
      (By contrast, evening classes in Germany are semester based and
      typically have no formal placement tests.)
      <abbr>CLT</abbr> offers 8 years of Standard Chinese language classes;
      a school year corresponds to 120 &ldquo;classroom hours&rdquo; of 50 minutes each.
    </p>
    <p>Standard Chinese language classes at <abbr>CLT</abbr> were based on a number of
      premises and prnciples, which include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The linguistic distance between Dutch and Chinese is much bigger than between
        Dutch and the other Indo-European languages taught at <abbr>CLT</abbr>
        (English, German, French, Spanish, etcetera). For this reason, Chinese
        is not taught entirely in the <strong>target language</strong> in the first 3 years.
        (Spanish is taught entirely in Spanish from the very beginning.)
      </li>
      <li>The lessons in the texbook (<i class="booktitle">New Practical Chinese Reader</i>)
        do not contain sufficient exercises to enable mastery of all the vocabulary,
        grammar and usage aspects presented in each lesson. For this reason,
        the teachers provided many <strong>additional exercises</strong>. These exercises are
        different from what can be found in the textbook.
      </li>
      <li>While language classes lead to a certain level of proficiency, there
        will always be things that a learner cannot say. For this reason,
        <strong>circumlocution</strong> is an important communicative strategy.
        (One of the teachers started emphasizing this after talking to students
        who had experienced difficulty buying a moquito net in Taiwan because 
        they did not know the word for it. This should type of situation should not
        poses a problem when circumlocution is used as a communicative strategy.)
      </li>
      <li>A significant part of grammar teaching relies on learners inferring rules
        from example sentences. This is sometimes humorously called <span lang="zh-CN">人民语法</span> (people's grammar).
      </li>
      <li>There is a strong emphasis on language production, both oral and written.</li>
      <li>In the first few years, classes are taught by native speakers of Dutch;
        later, they are taught by native speakers of Chinese.
      </li>
      <li>Correct pronunciation is very important, especially in the first two years.</li>
      <li>Chinese characters are taught from the beginning of the first year.</li>
      <li>When learners don't understand something, they are first encouraged to discuss it with each other.
        If the problem is really difficult, the teacher guides the learners in the right
        direction and eventually confirms whether the learners have come to the right conclusion.
        This can be seen as a kind of peer learning.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!--
      * Making it personal instead of speaking about characters in the textbook. Talking about oneself and learning about one's peers is more interesting than talking about textbook characters and will therefore "stick" better.
      * Characters: some basics are taught in the first year. Most character learning takes place at home, based on sheets with stroke order diagrams.
      * First two years: one hour per week in a language lab with a different teacher. 1: practice pronunciation; 2: hear a different teacher's pronunciation.
      * Use of audio and video, e.g. songs and short film clips, to reinforce what has just been learnt.
        For example, very early in the first year, a clip from Nemo, where learners tried to understand what the pelicans are saying: "wode".
        YouTube videos: e.g. Sexy Beijing.
      * Practise oral skills with other exercises - with peers. 
      * "Loopdictee".
      * Third year: start using a discussion forum. Not presented as "homework" -> much more lively; roughly 16 learners wrote over 600 messages in the course of 10 months.
        Corrections: colour codes. More production; faster progress.
        Limited grammatical knowledge played only a small role; few new grammar rules based on problems during forum discussions.
      * Fourth year: also create short films. (You often need to start over -> lot of language production.) 
        Fourth year: describe the place where you live. Fifth year: create a (humorous) ad video. Sixth year: interview a native speaker of Chinese.
        Short films are shown in language lab -> listening exercises for peers.
        (The sort films showed that, already in the fourth year, there was quite a wide range in proficiency levels. People who read text off-screen, versus people who stood in front of the camera and spoke for 30–60 seconds without a break. The latter is much more than what was expected at that level.) 
      * Newspaper text introduced in the third year, in spite of knowledge of only 350–400 characters. Find what you know (discuss with peers) instead of teacher testing that you understand most of the text.
      * Circumlocution etc. Find out another learner's name without being able to ask "What is your name?"; if-then-construction without ruguo (meiyou x, meiyou y); 
        3rd year: group discussion about the financial crisis without knowing Chinese words for crisis, interest. (Previous year had discussed the pension system.)
      * Listening to peers: e.g. "zhende/jiade": learner tells a story; other tries to guess whether it is true or not.
      * Production: third year: show panes from comics version of xiyouji -> what is happening? what do you understand?
      * Fifth/fourth (?) year: some texts from Mayan riji.
      * Sixth year: graded reader about old painting -> understand and describe what happens in the story.
      * HSK March 2009: teacher in third year thought it would be too difficult. Five people went and passed. After that, teachers started encouraging learners to participate.
        With the introduction with the New HSK in 2010, even learners in the first year were encouraged to participate.
