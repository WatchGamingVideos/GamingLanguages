    <h2>Theory and Tips</h2>
    <p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>
      and
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a>
      on Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>Spaced repetition is a popular technique based on research by the German
      psychologist 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus"><span lang="de">Hermann 
      Ebbinghaus</span></a> in the late 19th century.
      <span lang="de">Ebbinghaus</span> discovered the 
      &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">forgetting
      curve</a>&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing
      effect</a>&rdquo;.
      This would later lead to the development of the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner system</a>
      by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Leitner">Sebastian Leitner</a>.
      After computers became mainstream, others came up with electronic versions
      of this type of flashcard system. Spaced repetition programs schedule when
      a flashcard needs to be presented again and thereby take some of the hard
      work required by paper-based systems off your hands.
    </p>
    <p>Many people use flash cards only for vocabulary, although they can be
      used for any subject that can be broken down into simple tests.
      This includes grammar (e.g. using 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze tests</a>),
      geography, history, etcetera.
      Some people mistakenly think that spaced repetition is a 
      <a href="../methods/index.html">language learning method</a>; 
      it is actually a technique that should never be more
      than a part of the learning process, and most of the learning time 
      should be spent on other activities.

    <h2 id="software">Spaced Repetition Software</h2>
    <h3 id="anki">Anki</h3>
    <p><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> is a popular free and open source
      spaced repetition program by Damien Elmes that is available for Microsoft Windows,
      Mac OS X, <abbr>GNU</abbr>/Linux, <abbr>BSD</abbr>, Android and iPhone. 
      A detailed 
      <a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html">user manual</a>
      is available on the website.
      <a href="../methods/index.html#fluentforever">Gabriel Wyner</a>, 
      who is a great fan of Anki, has created Anki tutorials
      on YouTube: 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQkdB3cJwn0">How to install
      Anki and make your first flashcard</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkG0CTNSwg">Adding your first
      pictures from a frequency list</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEldkZJszjc">How to install a
      downloaded Anki deck (with media)</a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWDKXLvyJNc">How to learn simple 
      words using Anki</a>.
      <br />The program allows you to created flash card decks and share them 
      with other Anki users
      on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">ankiweb.net</a>.
      Even though you can use decks created by other people, it is
      highly recommended that you create your own. 
      <br />
      When revising decks, you can customise the settings, for example, how
      many flash cards should be presented per day, how many new ones should
      be shown, etcetera.
