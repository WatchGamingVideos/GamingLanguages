    <p>The techniques in this category are supported by research.</p>

    <h2>Other Techniques</h2>
    <p>The techniques in this category are not supported by research but
      have been developed or recommended by experienced language learners.
      (Some of these techniques are only listed here until I can find
      research about it.)

    <h3>Shadowing</h3>
    <p>Shadowing is a technique formulated by Alexander Arguelles.
      The first links below are to Arguelles' own explanations,
      but others have also picked it up.

        (For an explanation, Arguelles refers to his website; see the above links.)

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24">Shadowing Step by Step</a>,
        a 55-minute video about the technique.
        Arguelles recommends that you watch his other videos about shadowing first.

        <i class="YTChannel">Doing English with Julian</i>.
        Julian recommends shadowing to improve your pronunciation.
        In the basic version of shadowing described in this video, Julian recommends that you find some audio 
        (at your own level or slightly higher) and practise shadowing with it for an entire week.
        You should imitate the tone, rhythm, pauses etc. until you &ldquo;become&rdquo; the person you are shadowing.

      <li>Perras, Les:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLg3LaFtLt0">should you read the script before shadowing?</a>,
        a three-minute video about whether you should read the dialogue before shadowing.
        Les Perras provides a simple rule:
        <ol>
          <li>Advanced students should start shadowing directly without reading the script.</li>
          <li>Beginning students should read the script once or even twice before they begin shadowing.</li>
        </ol>
        However, it is a good idea to look at the script to avoid learning mistakes.

    <h3>Memory Palace or &ldquo;Method of Loci&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci</a>
      is a mnemonic technique that dates to ancient Greece and Rome.
      However, the only type of research it has been subjected to 
      involved brain scans

      <li><strong>10,000 sentences</strong>: a technique formulated by Khatzumoto
        (which he now considers outdated) and described in the blogpost
        <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-how">10,000 
        Sentences: How</a> (2006?).<br />

        Sentences: Input Before Output</a> (2007?) 
        he explains that the technique is based on 
        <a href="http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html">Stephen Krashen's theory of 
        second language acquisition</a> (especially the  
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">input hypothesis</a>
        and the importance of &ldquo;comprehensible input&rdquo;),
        and that it has been used by two Poles to learn English
        (see the articles
        <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/input-intro.htm">Input — what it is 
        and why you need it</a> and

    <h2>Language Learning Strategies</h2>
    <p>Language learning strategies refers to 
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Language_learning_strategies&oldid=664716652">the 
      processes and actions that are consciously deployed by language learners 
      to help them to learn or use a language more effectively</q> 
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_learning_strategies">Wikipedia</a>).
      <br />
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second-language_acquisition&oldid=679211890#Strategies">Strategies 
      are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies, 
      although there are other ways of categorizing them. 
      <strong>Learning strategies</strong> are techniques used to improve learning, 
      such as mnemonics or using a dictionary. 
      <strong>Communicative strategies</strong> are strategies a learner uses 
      to convey meaning even when she doesn't have access to the correct form, 
      such as using pro-forms like <i>thing</i>, or using non-verbal means 
      such as gestures.</q>
