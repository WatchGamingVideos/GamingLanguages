    <h2>Other Techniques</h2>
    <p>The techniques in this category are not supported by research but
      have been developed or recommended by experienced language learners.
      (Some of these techniques are only listed here until I can find
      research about it.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Language deconstruction</strong>:
        a technique by Tim Ferris that helps you find out what a language is
        like <em>before</em> you start learning it.
        See 
        <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/">How 
        to Learn (But Not Master) Any Language in 1 Hour (Plus: A Favor)</a>

        reading on Wikipedia</a>)
        (see also intensive reading, below).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Intensive reading</strong> (see also extensive reading, above).</li>
      <li><strong>Gold list</strong> &ldquo;method/methodology&rdquo; or 
        Goldlist Method
        (by <a href="http://huliganov.tv/goldlist-eu/">Viktor D. Huliganov</a>;
        not really a method but a kind of spaced repetition).

      </li>
      <li><strong>Shadowing</strong>: a technique formulated by Alexander 
        Arguelles.
        (See 
        <a href="http://www.foreignlanguageexpertise.com/foreign_language_study.html#svd">The 
        Shadowing Technique</a> and 
        <a href="http://languagegeek.net/2008/07/01/getting-started-with-shadowing/">Getting 
        Started with Shadowing</a>.)
      </li>
      <li><strong>10,000 sentences</strong>: a technique formulated by Khatzumoto
        (which he now considers outdated) and described in the blogpost
        <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-how">10,000 
        Sentences: How</a> (2006?).<br />
        Note that Khatzumoto does not claim to have invented the technique. In 
        his blogpost 
        <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-input-before-output">10,000 
        Sentences: Input Before Output</a> (2007?) 
        he explains that the technique is based on 
        <a href="http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html">Stephen Krashen's theory of 
        second language acquisition</a> (especially the  
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">input hypothesis</a>
        and the importance of &ldquo;comprehensible input&rdquo;),
        and that it has been used by two Poles to learn English
        (see the articles
        <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/input-intro.htm">Input â€” what it is 
        and why you need it</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/input-howmuch.htm">How much input 
        do you need to speak English fluently?</a> by 
        <span lang="pl">Tomasz P. Szynalski</span>).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Memory palace</strong> or &ldquo;method of loci&rdquo;:
        although this technique dates back to classical antiquity,
        the only type of research it has been subjected to 
        involved brain scans
        (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci
        on Wikipedia</a>).

    <h2>Language Learning Strategies</h2>
    <p>Language learning strategies refers to 
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Language_learning_strategies&oldid=664716652">the 
      processes and actions that are consciously deployed by language learners 
      to help them to learn or use a language more effectively</q> 
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_learning_strategies">Wikipedia</a>).
      <br />
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second-language_acquisition&oldid=679211890#Strategies">Strategies 
      are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies, 
      although there are other ways of categorizing them. 
      <strong>Learning strategies</strong> are techniques used to improve learning, 
      such as mnemonics or using a dictionary. 
      <strong>Communicative strategies</strong> are strategies a learner uses 
      to convey meaning even when she doesn't have access to the correct form, 
      such as using pro-forms like <i>thing</i>, or using non-verbal means 
      such as gestures.</q>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qanuvRoZYCw">Part 1</a>:
            explains what language learning strategies are, 
            asks students what strategies they use (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>
            using flashcards for vocabulary, using the language outside class,
            practice every day, making associations),

            figuring out what kind of learner you are (learning style:
            visual, auditory, kinesthetic), what kind of learning tasks you
            enjoy (depending on where you are on the introverted-extraverted
            continuum, on the closure-oriented versus open continuum),
            how you deal with new information (global versus particular),
            how you commit new material to memory (sharpeners versus leveler),
            how you deal with language rules (deductive versus inductive).
