  <main id="main">
    <p>Stack Exchange is a network of
      of question &amp; answer sites about specific topics. 
      People can ask questions or answer other people's questions.
      Both questions and answers can received upvotes and downvotes. 
      Upvotes on answers bring the &ldquo;best&rdquo; answers to the top.
      There are several Stack Exchange sites related to language.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone can propose a new Stack Exchange site. 
      The proposal will then go through several phases before the site can
      &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;: definition (which is mainly about which types of
      questions would be allowed), commit, and public beta.
      A beta site needs to acquire a specific critical mass (in users,
      daily visitors, number of questions per day, number of answers per question)
      before it can graduate.
    </p>

    <h2>&ldquo;Horizontal&rdquo; Sites</h2>

    <p>The first two sites are &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; in the sense that they 
      are not about a specific language but focus on a specific aspect that applies
      across languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/">Linguistics</a> (beta):

        <q>a question and answer site for students, teachers, polyglots, and anyone interested in the techniques of second-language acquisition</q>.
        (In spite of the description, the site is also accepts questions about first-language acquisition.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="languages">Language-Specific Sites</h2>
    <p>Most language-related sites focus on a specific language.
