# ISO Language Tags

ISO language tags (ISO 639-1, else ISO 639-3) for languages.
the languages are ordered by number of speakers according to the list in the
[Wikipedia article 'List of languages by number of native speakers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers).

## Notes
Some languages miss translations because the native language string could not be copied from Wikipedia (typically due to rendering issues of the script in the browser):

* `jv` (Javanese),
* `my` (Burmese)
